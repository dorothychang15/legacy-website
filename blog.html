            <h2 class="blog-post-title">‚òÄback in la: home sweet home‚òÄ</h2>
            <p class="blog-post-meta">June 8, 2016 by Dorothy</p>
            <p> First things first: happiest of 22nd birthdays to my brother Tim! A little about Tim: he's my older brother and my only sibling, a software engineer currently working at Amazon in Irvine, and probably the nicest person you will ever meet (except to me) and also the most sarcastic. Generally, people who know Tim like Tim, and of course, as his little sister, I grew up idolizing him. That illusion has long since shattered, but we still get along really well, and he's probably part of the reason I ended up in computer science. </p>
            <p> Now then, onto other things. I've been back in the LA area for almost a month now, and I honestly wonder why I ever left. Of course, I'm glad I went to Penn, because I met some pretty cool people and learned some pretty cool things, but there's something about southern Califoria that just feels like home: the sunshine, the warmth, the familiar sight of palm trees against the sky. The food is also top-notch- in the short weeks I've been home, I've enjoyed all-you-can-eat Korean barbeque, kimchi tofu soup with all the side dishes, sushi/sashimi (boat style), various editions of ramen and poke, $1 tacos from the truck by the gas station, and oodles and oodles of boba. Of course, being home also means lots of kale, quinoa, and all the exotic fruits and greens rarely- if ever- found in Penn dining halls. </p>
            <p> It's true that most of my time here has been spent eating/exploring new things to eat, but to be fair, I've tried to get some work done on the side, too. This is my third week as an intern at AuriQ Systems, a software company based in nearby Pasadena. I've had a few different part-time jobs, but this is my first full-time gig, and it definitely takes getting used to. Things are going well so far; more updates to come! For now, I'm just happy to be home, with family, friends, and food. ‚ò∫</p>

            <p class="blog-post-meta">February 20, 2016 by Dorothy</p>
            <p>Funny story: when I initially applied to participate in FemmeHacks, I received an email telling me that there wasn't enough room so I wouldn't be able to attend. Then, at a WiCS event the same week, I mentioned what had happened to a WiCS board member who also happened to be planning FemmeHacks, and she was taken aback because they hadn't intended for any Penn students to be excluded (since Penn WiCS was hosting the event). She took my email, and not long after I received an email welcoming me to FemmeHacks 2016.</p>
            <p>I'd never competed in a hackathon before: last September, I went to the fall edition of PennApps, but only for a day, and just to look around. Then there was the spring PennApps in January (don't ask), but I was working the event and catching up on homework, so the only code I wrote was for a project I was turning in two days late. FemmeHacks seemed like the perfect place to start: it was shorter (just a day) and women-in-tech-friendly. The day got off to an inauspicious start, though. My friend and I overslept and arrived about 3 hours late, at noon, and then spent the better part of the next 3 hours figuring out how to use Github collaboratively, something that turned out to be much more complicated than anticipated. In the end, we made just a small, simple decision maker and decided against submitting it for judging, but we did learn a lot. We also got lots of cool swag (FemmeHacks tanks and socks!), plus some pretty cute Polaroids, photo booth pictures, and alllllll the macarons you can eat from Sugar Philly. ‚ú® </p>

            <h2 class="blog-post-title">‚ùÑ2 weeks, 3 countries: winter break 2016‚ùÑ</h2>
            <p class="blog-post-meta">January 7, 2016 by Dorothy</p>
            <p> I've loved to travel for as long as I can remember. At some point, the plane rides became more monotonous than exciting, but no matter how tired I am from traveling, nothing beats the feeling of arriving somewhere I've never been. I especially love traveling to different countries because I get to stand in the middle of the airport and listen to everything around me- the sounds of foreign languages make for an excellent reminder that my next great adventure is about to begin. </p>
            <p> The last couple of weeks have been several adventures rolled into one: I flew to Taiwan with my mom and my brother on December 23rd, and we spent some quality time with our extended family in Kaohsiung. We also visited Dapeng Bay (Â§ßÈµ¨ÁÅ£), a lagoon on the southwest coast of Taiwan. It was hot and humid, as Taiwan always is, but the sunshine was a nice reprieve from the cold winter I'd left in Philly, and it's always a good time when Tim and I get together with all our cousins. </p>
            <p> Speaking of our cousins, the adults decided to set us loose in Hong Kong to ring in the new year, so we left on the 30th: 6 kids (if Tim can be called a kid) plus Stella, a family friend loosely designated as chaperone/tour guide. We proceeded to see as much of Hong Kong in as short a time as possible: we went on cable cars to see the city (and the giant Buddha), found more life-size Hello Kitty figurines than you'd imagine possible, and ate and drank everything Hong Kong had to offer (it was a lot). We counted down to the new year in Victoria Bay, and dragged our sleepy selves back to the hotel to recuperate for another 4 days of eating, exploring, and experiencing. We caught the Star Wars exhibit in Times Square on its last day, stopped by the "vintage" Starbucks, had an amateur photoshoot in the One Piece-themed 3D museum, and explored the chi art space mostly because it was free. </p>
            <p> We were all sad to leave Hong Kong, but our cousins had to get back to their studies, since in Taiwan, finals are right before the Lunar New Year. Tim and I were in for a treat, though: we left for Korea the very next day, on the 5th. As with all Asian tour groups, every day was a whirlwind of sightseeing and shopping. On our very first day, we covered Bukchon Hanok Village, Dongdaemun, and Lotte World. The day after, we went to Nami Island, where one of my favorite Korean reality shows (WGM) filmed a few years ago. It's better known as the filming site of Winter Sonata, one of the classic Korean dramas. We spent that night and the next day at a ski resort, and spent the last couple of days shopping (Myeongdong!) and eating excellent food, including street food like ddeokbokki and soondae, and 8-color Korean barbeque. Korea was a dream, and I cannot wait to go back (I've already started planning the next trip). </p>

            <p>Hi! I'm a sophomore studying computer science at the University of Pennsylvania. I grew up in Southern California, about an hour from the beach and 20 minutes from everywhere else. I love to explore new places, new foods, and new technologies, and this is where i write about all three. </p>
