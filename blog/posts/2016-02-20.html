            <p class="blog-post-meta">February 20, 2016</p>
            <p>Pre-story: a few days after I signed up for FemmeHacks, I received an email explaining that they were over-capacity so unfortunately, I wouldn't be able to participate. Then, at a WiCS event later that week, I mentioned what had happened to a WiCS board member in passing. She was actually one of the FemmeHacks organizers, and she was taken aback because they hadn't intended for any Penn students to be excluded from participating (since Penn WiCS was hosting the event). She took my email, and a little while later I received an email welcoming me to FemmeHacks 2016.</p>
            <p>I'd never competed in a hackathon before: last September, I went to the fall edition of PennApps, but only for a day, and just to look around. Then there was the spring PennApps in January (don't ask), but I was working the event and catching up on homework, so the only code I wrote was for a project I was turning in two days late. FemmeHacks seemed like the perfect place to start: it was shorter (just a day) and women-in-tech-friendly. Admittedly, it didn't go as well as planned: my friend and I both overslept and arrived late, and then we spent the better part of the afternoon unsuccessfully trying to figure out how to use Github to work collaboratively. In the end, we made just a small, simple decision maker and didn't finish in time to submit it for judging, but we did learn a lot. We also got lots of cool swag (FemmeHacks tanks and socks!), plus some pretty cute Polaroids, photo booth pictures, and alllllll the macarons you can eat from Sugar Philly. âœ¨ </p>
