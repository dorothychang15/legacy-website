            <p class="blog-post-meta">July 17, 2016</p>
            <p>July weekends are a precious time: the glorious middle of summer when you've sufficiently recuperated from the stress and exhaustion of finals, and the fall semester is too far away to cause any anxiety. We decided to make use of this particular Sunday by taking the family to Redondo Beach, a moderate hour-long drive from our house and generally less crowded than Santa Monica. Beaches in Los Angeles in the summer are always overcrowded, though, something we realized when we arrived at the beachfront and spent approximately forever circling around the parking structure looking for a spot. We were lucky enough to meet another family heading out who were kind enough to gesture to us to follow them to where their car was parked.  Once we finally parked, it was pretty great: the warm sun, cool sea breeze, the beautiful, clear water and the adorable boats that are always lined up on display, invariably painted with some combination of white, blue, green, and orange. I love the bustle of people, and the beach in summer is perfect for that: kids squealing with delight in the arcade, seafood vendors bellowing order numbers, and on this particular day, the common exchange of "Hey, there's a Magikarp! Wait there's a Goldeen too!"</p>
            <p> I really hope you know what Magikarp and Goldeen are, either because you (a) share my childhood love of Pokemon, (b) play Pokemon Go, or (c) both. I am absolutely obsessed with the game, for so many reasons. (Go Team Instinct!) There's my previously mentioned nostalgia for Pokemon, and the joy that comes with living the Pokemon trainer dream in real life, and the Virtual Reality aspect that's really set it apart from the Pokemon games of years past. I fully own up to being a Pokemon nerd, and though I'm not as dedicated as the people taking over gyms at 3am and organizing the Pokemon in Go by rarity, I am geeked out enough to research the Eevee evolution mystery before evolving my Flareon, and to stop driving, pull over, and run across the street for a Snorlax outline 3 steps away. I think it's incredibly interesting that Pokemon Go is the first VR game to be this explosive, and that it's become such a global phenom. So far, virtual reality has been widely talked about but seen as pretty out of reach in the public. Oculus Rifts and their ilk are now fairly common demonstrations at gaming conventions, but most un-techies haven't experienced VR just yet. And while a Pikachu on my office desk is pretty different from using Rift to transport myself to a different universe, I think Pokemon Go's a sign of things to come, and I'm so excited to see what kinds of VR applications Go will inspire developers to create.</p>
            <p> A little bit more about our day at Redondo Beach: lots of water-type Pokemon were caught, including Magikarp, Goldeen, Horsea, and Psyduck. Though the servers were down for most of the afternoon, towards the end of the day the congestion lightened up. All in all, I highly recommend Redondo's waterfront: Pokemon are top-notch, and oysters are delicious. Peep my pictures below!</p>
            <p> Finally, before I sign off, another internship update: I wrote a second blog post! This time, I wrote about the challenges of using open data that isn't neatly prepackaged like the AWS datasets I talked about previously. I also discussed some Essentia examples I created from non-AWS open data, which is pretty interesting to work with because each data set comes with its own organization and formatting, some of which varies from year to year as organizations update their data methodologies. <a href="http://www.auriq.com/blog/2016/07/15/open-data-and-essentia-part-2/">Read more here.</a></p>
